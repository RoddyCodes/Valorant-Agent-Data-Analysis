# Valorant Agent Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes agent performance in Valorant for the **Ascendant** rank, focusing on:
- **Win Rates**: Determining which agents have the highest win rates.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluating agents based on key metrics like Kill/Death Ratio (K/D), Average Damage Delta, and Average Combat Score (ACS).

The project provides insights into agent effectiveness to help players and analysts better understand the meta.

---

## Features
### 1. Win Rate Analysis
- Calculates win rates for all agents in the Ascendant rank.
- Visualizes win rates using bar charts.

### 2. Performance Metrics
- Analyzes and visualizes metrics:
  - **K/D Ratio**: Ratio of kills to deaths.
  - **Average Damage Delta**: Difference in average damage dealt and received.
  - **ACS**: Average Combat Score, a key performance indicator in Valorant.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd valorant-data-science
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### 3. Run the Scripts
#### Prepare the Data:
```bash
python prepare_data.py
```

#### Analyze Win Rates:
```bash
python analyze_win_rates.py
```

#### Analyze Performance Metrics:
```bash
python analyze_agent_metrics.py
```

## Results
### 1. Win Rate Analysis
- **Visualization**: `agent_win_rates.png` displays the win rates for agents in the Ascendant rank.

### 2. Performance Metrics Analysis
- **Visualizations**:
  - `agent_kdr.png`: K/D ratios by agent.
  - `agent_avg_dmg_delta.png`: Average damage delta by agent.
  - `agent_acs.png`: ACS by agent.

## Dataset
### Source
- Original data: `valorant_games.csv`
- Filtered data for Ascendant rank: `ascendant_data.csv`
- Dataset retrieved from [Kaggle - My First 1000 Valorant Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitchellharrison/my-first-1000-valorant-games).

---

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional ranks for comparative analysis.
- Analyze map-specific performance for agents.
- Explore machine learning models to predict match outcomes.
